# 01sandclock
The Digital Sand Clock is a modern take on the traditional hourglass, built using an Arduino and a 4-digit 7-segment display. It functions as a countdown timer that visually mimics a sand clock by counting down minutes and seconds in real-time.

The timer begins from a preset duration (e.g., 1 minute) and updates every second. Once it reaches zero, a buzzer sounds to indicate completion, and the clock automatically resets to simulate the "flip" of a sandglass. A push button allows users to manually reset or flip the timer at any time.

This project demonstrates concepts of timekeeping, display interfacing, button control, and buzzer output which is ideal for learning basic embedded systems and Arduino programming.
